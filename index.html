    <h1>Mohammed Saad Khan</h1>

    <p>Life is a complex process consisting of numerous
         ups and downs. The unpredictable nature of life means that a
          significant number of events are unplanned and can never be 
          mitigated by the person affected. Encountering these new events
           each day probes the person affected to respond to the problem. The
            response depends on the circumstances surrounding the person at that 
            particular point in time. Conflict occurs when there is a failure of 
            resolution of the problem (Tiffany). The individual fails to decide on which 
            course of action to take. This results in internal feelings of distress, anxiety,
             depression, or even aggression. Depression and aggression mainly develop when
              the task seems insurmountable. These are the wrong ways of handling any conflict.
               In the movie, Desmond responds to every conflict in a coolly, assured manner. 
               When Pearl Harbor is attacked, he does not join the Army to seek revenge.
                He instead enlists to provide medical support for his fellow countrymen.
                 It is his belief in ensuring the preservation of life that drives him to
                  the battlefield. Internal conflicts eventually manifest externally.
                   Doss is a prime case of how a consistent set of beliefs can provide 
                   comfort when faced with challenges and the need for consistency.
                    These beliefs can be used regularly for solving any issues.
                     You do not need to change your winning formula even when faced with greater odds.
                      If all these are observed, conflict/ war can be easily avoided/ won. Through
                       the resolution of his internal conflicts, he inspires the soldiers to have the strength to
                        face the current external conflict.</p>

                    The movie starts off with the Warrens and a priest trying to drive 
                    the evil spirit out of David’s body. According to Chaves, 
                    there are no photographs from the actual exorcism,
                    but multiple witnesses said that David levitated.
                     Audiences have seen that in a lot of exorcism movies,
                     so “we wanted to really put them back on their heels,”
                      Chaves says. He opted for a sequence where David is
                       bone-crackingly turned into a human pretzel.
                       “When you see levitation, there's something magical about that,"
                     Chaves says. "But seeing a little child going through these contortions 
                     and essentially being physically tortured was much more unsettling."</h3>

                         typically living under vows of poverty,
                         chastity, and obedience in the enclosure of a monastery or convent.</h4>
